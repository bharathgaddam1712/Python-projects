# Gold Price Prediction Model

We in this project would forecast gold rates using the most comprehensive set of features and would apply various machine learning algorithms for forecasting and compare their results. We also identify the attributes that highly influence the gold rates. We would use SPDR Gold Trust (GLD) Exchange Traded Fund data downloaded from https://finance.yahoo.com in the date range of 18/11/2004 to 01/01/2019. We would try to predict Adjusted Close price of GLD ETF, the detail about the data would be described in the Dataset and Input section below.

We have ensemble top three performing models to predict the Adjusted close price of Gold.

# Highlights
*The Goal of this project is to accurately predict the future adjusted closing price of Gold ETF across a given period of time in the future. For this project I have used different Machine Learning Algorithms and ensemble the solution model by combining top three performing models to predict the Adjusted closing price of the GLD ETF using a dataset of past prices.

Highlights of the Project:

1.How to apply machine learning techniques on Timeseries Data.

2.How to perform statistical analysis of Timeseries Data.

3.How to collect and preprocess given data.

4.How to ensemble different machine learning models and analyze model's performance.

5.How to optimise Machine Learning models to increase accuracy and reduction in error.
